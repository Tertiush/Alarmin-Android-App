# Alarmin
Alamin is an android app for controlling Paradox alarms through an IP module. 

## Important Notice
The Andorid application Alarmin is no longer being maintained. This is as a result of breaking changes introduced into the Android framework causing compatibility issues. The current version along with its push notification will however remain as-is for as long as technically and financially possible, with the current code base.

## Going forward
I am considering open-sourcing the bulk of Alarmin's code to allow other developers to offer alternatives, whom will hopefully have the resources to continue to support it in the future. Such discussions will be done within this project's GitHub "Issues" list.
